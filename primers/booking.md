# Booking Mirantis Classes for Administrators

If you'd like to book a new Mirantis Training class as an administrator, follow the steps below.

## Creating a new Class

1.  Visit https://training.mirantis.com/a/admin/training/events/create. If you're asked to log in, use your email and password.

2.  Choose the *Course* and *Location* from the dropdown menu. If you don't see the location you want, you can make a new one at https://training.mirantis.com/a/admin/training/locations/create.

3.  Click the *Private* checkbox if this event is for a private client. If you *don't*, then this class will be listed on the public schedule at https://training.mirantis.com/training/.

4.  Fill in the start and end dates and times. Times are in the timezone specified for the *Location* you chose above.

5.  If this is a public class, fill in the link to where students can enroll in your class under *Enrollment URL*.

6.  Under *Strigo Class*, choose the lab environment you want for this class. If you aren't sure, choose the one marked LATEST.

7.  Choose the instructor for the class from the *Instructor* dropdown. If you don't see the instructor you want, contact training-partner@mirantis.com to get them added to your list.

8.  If this is just a system test or instructor learning that will not have actual students (for example, for administrators to practice setting up an event or for a new instructor to try out the lab platform), click the *This is a test event and should not be inoivced* checkbox.

9.  Click *Save*

10. You will automatically be taken to the *Event Detail* page. Make sure the details are correct, and send the *Strigo URL* and *Strigo Access Token* to the instructor for the course.

## After a Class Finishes

1.  Return to the Event Detail page (you can find it by searching by date at https://training.mirantis.com/a/admin/training/events).

2.  If any students should NOT count towards invoicing (for example: by prior written agreement with Mirantis Training or duplicate registrations), mark them as such in the student list at the bottom of this Event Detail page. *You have one week after the end of class to do this before you are invoiced for all other students*.

3.  Also on the *Event Detail* page, you can click on *Export Survey Results* at the top of the page to get student survey results for your class.
